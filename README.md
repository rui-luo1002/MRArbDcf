# Magnetic Resonance Arbitrary Density Compensation Function (MRArbDcf, MAD)

## Introduction
This is the code repository for paper "Sampling Density Compensation using Fast Fourier Deconvolution" [1]. To fill the gap that the previous iterative DCF methods are slow (especially in 3D), this package provides a non-iterative method based on fast Fourier deconvolution. This package supports both CPU and GPU and can derive DCF for a trajectory designed for a 256³ matrix size in 20 seconds on a multi-core CPU or 10 seconds on a GPU.

## Installation
You can install this package either via pip:
```bash
$ pip install mrarbdcf
```
or offline
```bash
$ bash install.bash
```

Optionally, to enable CUDA acceleration in this package, you need to install `cufinufft` and `cupy`. It's recommended to read their official installation guides before installing - pip is not the best source for installation because some dependencies are only available from conda.

## Usage
For tutorials, you can find examples in the `example` folder. Most functions are well-commented in the Google style. We plan to release the documents on `readthedocs.org` in the future.

## Acknowledgement
FINUFFT [2,3] and CUFINUFFT [4] are used as NUFFT operators in this package. We thank the authors for their contributions to create such fast NUFFT libraries.
